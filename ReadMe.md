Simple kerbal mod downloader and installer made using the nuget.core libraries.

Because of the nuget reuse, this requires packages to be added independently of kerbal spaceport.

KerbalServer is an ASP.net based nuget server that can be run locally in IIS, though I also have instance running on Azure.

KerbalWinDownloader is the mod client, which can download the mods and install them to the specified kerbal install directory.
